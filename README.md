# Calculator-App
I used to delivered food on a bike during the summer. 
Deliveries average 40 per day and keeping track of the tips I earned and the money I owe to the store is a real pain. 
I couldn't find any apps on the playstore to help me in record keeping. Solution? Why not just code one myself?


Feel free to download the apk file and use it to install the app and run it. I would be EXTREAMLY flatter and grateful if you find this app to be actually useful :)
To download and install, just download and install the apk file in my master directory. Be sure to allow unknown sources on your android phone first.
