# Calculator-App
I used to delivered food on a bike during the summer. 
Deliveries average 40 per day and keeping track of the tips I earned and the money I owe to the store is a real pain. 
I couldn't find any apps on the playstore to help me in record keeping. Solution? Why not just code one myself?


If you would like to download my app, just download and install the apk file in my master directory. Be sure to allow unknown sources on your android phone first.
